# calculator

A fully functional calculator with a variety of operators, including basic (addition, subtraction, division and multiplications) and more complex ones (factorial, sqrt, etc.). Also comes with memory function. 

This website allowed to me utilise all the foundations of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I refined my usage of flexbox and color palettes to design the calculator, and I spent a lot of time mastering DOM manipulation, especially when it came to showing things on the display.
